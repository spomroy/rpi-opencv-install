# rpi-opencv-install
Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Stretch) OpenCV Installation

The idea here is to automate as many of the steps for installing OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi as possible in order to facilitate clean/consistent setups from one Raspberry Pi to the next. It also makes it as easy as possible to get up and running without having to delve too deeply into the various substeps of the installation.

Code is based on [this great blog post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/) from Adrian Rosebruck. All of the details behind each step are well explained there.
